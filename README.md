~~# Bibot (From _The Scarlet Pimpernel_)~~
~~Welcome to this unique discord bot! It is inspired from the novel, *The Scarlet Pimpernel*. In the novel, there is a character named Sergeant Bibot. He utters, "Morbleu!", [which expresses surprise and/or annoyance in French](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/morbleu).~~

~~This is a simple bot. The primary feature is returning "Morbleu!" when someone in the chat says, "Bibot". However, there are other keywords, and more may be added in the future!~~

~~# Example ~~
